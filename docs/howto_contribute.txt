HOW TO CONTRIBUTE:

If you want to help out, please don't hesitate to give a sensible pull request.
I will be happy to review and incorporate as needed.

Just a reminder on the pull request that you would send:
 * Patch should be a unified change that you think would improve the shcf codebase
  and your Fullname or github account name in docs/contributor.txt

 * Put a comment as to why this pull request of yours should be merged to current 
  master branch.

Thanks in advance.
