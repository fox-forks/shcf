"spawn" was conceptualized way before shcf was fully turned into an ShSDK. Therefore,
   - clean-up all reference to framework directories. MUST BE referencing 'project/projectname' directories
   - ensure use of temp directory within 'project/projectname'
   - Add the 'project/projectname/opt/spawned' reference in config file
   - test on linux (specially syntax for usage of 'mktemp')
   - any other optimizations
   - test on 'spawning' shsdk itself

NOTE: Delete this notes once ready to merge to master.
